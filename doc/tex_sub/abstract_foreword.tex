{\small
The ocean engine of NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) is a primitive 
equation model adapted to regional and global ocean circulation problems. It is intended to 
be a flexible tool for studying the ocean and its interactions with the others components of 
the earth climate system over a wide range of space and time scales. 
Prognostic variables are the three-dimensional velocity field, a non-linear sea surface height, 
the \textit{Conservative} Temperature and the \textit{Absolute} Salinity. 
In the horizontal direction, the model uses a curvilinear orthogonal grid and in the vertical direction, 
a full or partial step $z$-coordinate, or $s$-coordinate, or a mixture of the two. 
The distribution of variables is a three-dimensional Arakawa C-type grid. 
Various physical choices are available to describe ocean physics, including TKE, and GLS vertical physics. 
Within NEMO, the ocean is interfaced with a sea-ice model (LIM or CICE), passive tracer and 
biogeochemical models (TOP) and, via the OASIS coupler, with several atmospheric general circulation models. 
It also support two-way grid embedding via the AGRIF software.
