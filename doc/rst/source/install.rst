Prerequisites
=============

- The NEMO source code is written in Fortran 95 and some of its prerequisite
  tools and libraries are already included in the (``./ext``) subdirectory. These
  include: the AGRIF preprocessing program "conv"; the FCM build system and the 
  IOIPSL library for parts of the output.
|
- Other requirements that your system needs to provide include: a Perl 5 interpreter; a modern
  Fortran compiler (ifort, gfortran, pgfortran, ...) and (in most cases) a MPI library
  (e.g. OpenMPI or MPICH). The latter is not strictly essential since it is possible
  to compile and run NEMO on a single processor. However most realistic configurations
  will require the parallel capabilities of NEMO and these use the Message Passing
  Interface (MPI) library. NEMO v4.0, by default, uses some MPI features introduced
  into the MPI-3 standard. On older systems, that do not support these features, 
  the key_mpi2 preprocessor key should be used at compile time. This will limit MPI
  features to those defined within the MPI-2 standard (but will lose some performance
  benefits).
|
The following prerequisites may already be installed or be available from the
official repositories of your Linux distribution. However access to all the
options available with the XIOS IO-server will require the parallel form of the
netcdf4 library and its underlying HDF5 library. It is also necessary to compile
these libraries with the same version of the MPI library that both NEMO and XIOS
(see below) are compiled and linked with. To satisfy these requirements, it is common 
to have to compile the following from source.

- `HDF5`_   (C library) (use: --enable-fortran --enable-parallel with configure)
- `NetCDF4`_ (C and Fortran libraries)

Note that particular versions of these libraries may have their own
restrictions. For example, the latest versions of the netCDF libraries:
netcdf-c-4.6.2 and netcdf-fortran-4.4.4, state the following requirements for netCDF-4 support:

* HDF5 1.8.9 or later.
* HDF5 1.10.1 or later.
* zlib 1.2.5 or later (for netCDF-4 compression)
* curl 7.18.0 or later (for DAP remote access client support)

|
`Important Note: When building netCDF-C library versions older than 4.4.1,
use only HDF5 1.8.x versions. Combining older netCDF-C versions with newer
HDF5 1.10 versions will create superblock 3 files that are not readable by
lots of older software.`

Extract and install XIOS
========================

With the sole exception of running NEMO in mono-processor mode (in which case
output options are limited to those supported by the IOIPSL library), diagnostic
outputs from NEMO are handled by the third party XIOS library. This can be used
in two different modes:

* attached - Every NEMO process also acts as a XIOS server
* dettached - Every NEMO process runs as a XIOS client. Output is collected and collated by external,
  stand-alone XIOS server processors.

In either case, it is important to note that XIOS needs to be compiled before
NEMO, since the libraries are needed to successfully create the NEMO executable.

Instructions on how to obtain and install the software can be found on the `XIOS Wiki`_ .

It is recommended to use XIOS version 2.5 with NEMOv4.0. This version should be more stable (in terms of 
future code changes) than the XIOS trunk. It is also the version used by the NEMO system team when 
testing all developments and new releases. This particular version has its own branch and can be 
checked out and downloaded with:

.. code:: console

        $ svn co http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ioserver/svn/XIOS/branchs/xios-2.5

Setup your architecture configuration file
==========================================

All compiler options in NEMO are controlled using files in
trunk/arch/arch-'my_arch'.fcm where 'my_arch' is the name of the computing
architecture.  It is recommended to copy and rename an configuration file from
an architecture similar to your owns. You will need to set appropriate values
for all of the variables in the file. In particular the FCM variables:
``%NCDF_HOME``; ``%HDF5_HOME`` and ``%XIOS_HOME`` should be set to the
installation directories used for XIOS installation.

.. code-block:: sh

        %NCDF_HOME           /opt/local
        %HDF5_HOME           /opt/local
        %XIOS_HOME           /Users/$( whoami )/xios-2.5
        %OASIS_HOME          /not/defined

Compile and create NEMO executable
==================================

The main script to compile and create executable is called makenemo and located in the CONFIG directory, it is used to identify the routines you need from the source code, to build the makefile and run it.
As an example, compile GYRE with 'my_arch' to create a 'MY_GYRE' configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

	./makenemo –m 'my_arch' –r GYRE -n 'MY_GYRE'

The image below shows the structure and some content of "MY_CONFIG" directory from the launching of the configuration creation (directories and fundamental files created by makenemo).

+------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| ``WORK``   |                                                    |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------+

Folder with the symbolic links to all unpreprocessed routines considered in the configuration
Compilation folder (executables, headers files, libraries, preprocessed routines, flags, …)
Computation folder for running the model (namelists, xml, executables and inputs-outputs)
Folder intended to contain your customised routines (modified from initial ones or new entire routines)

After successful execution of makenemo command, the executable called opa is created in the EXP00 directory (in the example above, the executable is created in CONFIG/MY_GYRE/EXP00).

More makenemo options
---------------------

``makenemo`` has several other options that can control which source files are selected and the operation
of the build process itself. These are:

.. code-block:: sh

        Optional:
           -d   Set of new sub-components (space separated list from ./src directory)
           -e   Path for alternative patch  location (default: 'MY_SRC' in configuration folder)
           -h   Print this help
           -j   Number of processes to compile (0: no build)
           -n   Name for new configuration
           -s   Path for alternative source location (default: 'src' root directory)
           -t   Path for alternative build  location (default: 'BLD' in configuration folder)
           -v   Level of verbosity ([0-3])

These options can be useful for maintaining several code versions with only minor differences but they 
should be used sparingly. Note however the ``-j`` option which should be used more routinely to speed up
the build process. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

        ./makenemo –m 'my_arch' –r GYRE -n 'MY_GYRE' -j 8

which will compile up to 8 modules simultaneously.


Default behaviour
-----------------

At the first use, you need the -m option to specify the architecture
configuration file (compiler and its options, routines and libraries to
include), then for next compilation, it is assumed you will be using the
same compiler.  If the –n option is not specified the last compiled configuration
will be used.

Tools used during the process
-----------------------------

*   functions.sh : bash functions used by makenemo, for instance to create the WORK directory
*   cfg.txt : text list of configurations and source directories
*   bld.cfg : FCM rules to compile 

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: sh

        echo "Example to install a new configuration MY_CONFIG";
        echo "with OPA_SRC and LIM_SRC_2 ";
        echo "makenemo -n MY_CONFIG -d \"OPA_SRC LIM_SRC_2\"";
        echo "";
        echo "Available configurations :"; cat ${CONFIG_DIR}/cfg.txt;
        echo "";
        echo "Available unsupported (external) configurations :"; cat ${CONFIG_DIR}/uspcfg.txt;
        echo "";
        echo "Example to remove bad configuration ";
        echo "./makenemo -n MY_CONFIG clean_config";
        echo "";
        echo "Example to clean ";
        echo "./makenemo clean";
        echo "";
        echo "Example to list the available keys of a CONFIG ";
        echo "./makenemo list_key";
        echo "";
        echo "Example to add and remove keys";
        echo "./makenemo add_key \"key_iomput key_mpp_mpi\" del_key \"key_agrif\" ";
        echo "";
        echo "Example to add and remove keys for a new configuration, and do not compile";
        echo "./makenemo -n MY_CONFIG -j0 add_key \"key_iomput key_mpp_mpi\" del_key \"key_agrif\" ";

Running the model
=================

Once makenemo has run successfully, the opa executable is available in ``CONFIG/MY_CONFIG/EXP00``
For the reference configurations, the EXP00 folder also contains the initial input files (namelists, \*xml files for the IOs…). If the configuration also needs NetCDF input files, this should be downloaded here from the corresponding tar file, see Users/Reference Configurations

.. code-block:: sh

        cd 'MY_CONFIG'/EXP00
        mpirun -n $NPROCS ./opa    # $NPROCS is the number of processes ; mpirun is your MPI wrapper


Viewing and changing list of active CPP keys
============================================

For a given configuration (here called MY_CONFIG), the list of active CPP keys can be found in:

.. code-block:: sh

        trunk/cfgs/'MYCONFIG'/cpp_'MY_CONFIG'.fcm


This text file can be edited to change the list of active CPP keys. Once changed, one needs to recompile opa executable using makenemo command in order for this change to be taken in account.
Note that most NEMO configurations will need to specify the following CPP keys:

*   key_iomput
*   key_mpp_mpi
