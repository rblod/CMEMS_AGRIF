================
NEMO Ocean Model
================

NEMO_ (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) is a state-of-the-art modelling framework of 
ocean related engines for oceanographic research, operational oceanography, seasonal forecast and 
[paleo]climate studies.

The NEMO ocean model has 3 major components:

- :rstblue:`OPA` is fundamental to all users by modelling the ocean [thermo]dynamics and 
  solving the primitive equations;
- :rstgrey:`LIM` for sea-ice simulates ice [thermo]dynamics, brine inclusions and 
  subgrid-scale thickness variations;
- :rstgreen:`TOP-PISCES` models biogeochemistry with TOP for 
  the on/offline oceanic tracers transport and PISCES for the biogeochemical processes.

These physical engines are described in their respective `reference publications`_.

They are complemented by a 2-way nesting software (AGRIF_) and 
a versatile data assimilation interface with 3 different modules
(linear-tangent TAM, observational operators OBS, and increment ASM).

------------
Applications
------------

| Distributed under CeCILL license (GNU GPL compatible - see ``LICENSE``), 
  the framework offers several builtins reference configurations to 
  check your computing architecture and evaluate the model skills and performances (``./cfgs``).
| The end user could also find some idealized test cases on the web to serve as examples and 
  to study particular processes.

A set of tools is also provided to setup your own configuration and 
[pre|post]process your data (``./tools``).

-------
Options
-------

For writing diagnostics in a efficient way, NEMO make use of XIOS_ server which 
controlled the outputs using XML input file.

To enable Earth system modelling, NEMO can be interfaced via 
OASIS_ coupleur to external components such as atmospheric models or 
alternative models of sea-ice or biogeochemistry.

-------------
Documentation
-------------

The NEMO reference manual can be generated from the LaTeX source code (``./doc``), 
either in PDF or in HTML format, but it mights require some additionnal installations.

In any case, both formats are available online on the `NEMO website`__.

---------------------
Community development
---------------------

| The NEMO Consortium gathering 6 European institutes organises the sustainable development in order to 
  keep a reliable evolving system since 2008.
| It defined the multiyear development strategy which is implemented by the NEMO System Team.
